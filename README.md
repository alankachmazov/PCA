# Principal Component Analysis
This is an individual project written in R. Principal Component Analysis is performed to obtain some insights from  the data, investigate possible correlations between variables and vizualise the findings.  

This project is provided as an R Markdown (Rnw) file. It's important to note that you shouldn't simply use it in plain R. Follow these steps to make the most out of this project:

1. **Install R and RStudio:** If you haven't already, make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your system. You can download them from the official websites:
   - [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
   - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

2. **Open the R Markdown File:** Open the `project.Rmd` (or `.Rnw`) file provided in this repository using RStudio.

3. **Knit the Document:** In RStudio, click the "Knit" button to render the R Markdown document. This will execute the R code within the document and generate a formatted report with explanations, code outputs, and visualizations.

4. **Follow the Interactive Guide:** Navigate through the document interactively. You'll find explanations, code snippets, and visualizations that will guide you through the PCA analysis in R.
